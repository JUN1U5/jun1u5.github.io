Great news for those of you who love to sample (and those of you who love sample-style hip-hop from DJ Shadow to the Alchemist, from Ghostface to Kanye: the sample-stifling precedent of [Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport_Music_Inc._v._Dimension_Films) has been [rejected by the New York Supreme Court](http://lessig.org/mt/mt-tb.cgi/2256).  
  
In 2005, after a federal judge found that a two-second Funkadelic guitar chord used (without permission or compensation) in NWA's ["100 Miles and Runnin"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6YOq2xn3k4) did not violate copyright law, an appeals court reversed the decision. Barely concealing its contempt for hip-hop, [the court ordered](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-09-08-sampling-ruling_x.htm): "Get a license or do not sample. We do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way."  
  
Recently, the litigious [Yoko Ono attempted to block _Expelled: No Intelligence_](http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2320158220080423) because it contained 15 seconds of Lennon's "Imagine." In defense of the straightforward usage of Lennon's song in the "intelligent design" film, the court's decision rejected the Bridgeport/NWA precedent, which held that any sampling of music--no matter how minimal--violated copyright law.
  
By the way, the Bridgeport back-story gets more insidious. Apparently, Bridgeport (the music corporation) is simply one man, a notorious "sample troll" who brings suit after suit -- [against Jay-Z recently](http://hiphoparchive.org/thecircle/2006/12/01/jay-z-versus-the-sample-troll/) -- in order to extort money from old rights. What's more? [George Clinton has explained that his signature was forged by Bridgeport on many of the contracts](http://www.techdirt.com/blog.php?company=bridgeport) for Funkdelic's songs, including ["Get Off your Ass and Jam"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siLtUWq0xio) (the track in the NWA case).
