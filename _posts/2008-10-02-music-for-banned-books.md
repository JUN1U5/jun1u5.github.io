title: Musical Accompaniment for Banned Books
---

*This post was resurrected from a defunct music blog I worked on from 2008-2010. The blog wasn't successful, but I always enjoyed this post.*

It's [Banned Books Week](http://everybodyslibraries.com/2008/09/29/why-banned-books-week-matters/), an annual celebration of artistic expression (the freedom to write) and the freedom of the press (the freedom to read), observed this year by [Amnesty International](http://www.amnestyusa.org/events/banned-books-week/page.do?id=1101492&n1=5&n2=50&n3=1611), the [American Library Association](http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.cfm), and others. This isn't just a ploy to get teenagers reading old books (as satirized by [the Onion](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28619) -- it's a chance to challenge yourself and challenge those around you by reading stuff others would rather you didn't. Hey, finding those [books deemed unfit for minors](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html#nowrite) is pretty much what got me through high school. So, rather than pick up the relatively safe (but still naughty) Canterbury Tales or Fanny Hill, here's my list of 5 riskier and more entertaining choices, in no particular order:

*   [Lolita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita) (1955) by Nabokov (long unpublished in English, seized by customs in the UK, banned in France).
*   [The Atrocity Exhibition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atrocity_Exhibition) (1970) or [Crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%281973_novel%29) (1973) by Ballard. No, not the basis for the horrible movie with Ludacris, but it was [adapted by Cronenberg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115964/) and the 1996 film was also controversial. The first run of Ballard's experimental Atrocity Exhibition was destroyed by Doubleday.
*   [Naked Lunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Lunch) (1959) by Burroughs. The target of the last major [print] censorship trial in the US. I bet you'd still have a hard time finding it in a school library.
*   [A Clockwork Orange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange) (1962) by Burgess. If you've seen Kubrick's film, you can see why it's frequently challenged and removed from school libraries.

And while you're taking a well-deserved break from [Ulysses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29), why not listen to some banned music? We celebrate Banned Books Week, but the fight against censorship in music is still ongoing. Take a look back on...

*   [2 Live Crew - As Nasty As They Wanna Be](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbaFM_CA4mw). 808 beats and a 1992 court overruling that remain at the heart of hip-hop.
*   [N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkPb4s0-QcI). The classic album, as well as 2 Live's Nasty, were both banned in Tennessee.
*   [Public Enemy - Hazy Shade of Criminal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOd48zlNkA). Banned from MTV because of violence and yet it's largely a protest against government-sanctioned violence, hmmmm....
*   [DJ Dangermouse - The Grey Album](http://www.bannedmusic.org/albums/grey_album.php). [Censorship continues under copyright law](http://www.bannedmusic.org/), so here's one of the highest achievements of "illegal" art ever.
