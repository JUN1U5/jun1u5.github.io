title: Musical Accompaniment for Banned Books

***
This post was resurrected from a defunct music blog I worked on from 2008-2010. The blog wasn't successful, but I always enjoyed this post.

It's [Banned Books Week][1], an annual celebration of artistic expression (the freedom to write) and the freedom of the press (the freedom to read), observed this year by [Amnesty International][2], the [American Library Association][3], and others. This isn't just a ploy to get teenagers reading old books (as hilariously satirized by [the Onion][4]) -- it's a chance to challenge yourself and challenge those around you by reading stuff others would rather you didn't. Hey, finding those [books deemed unfit for minors][5] is pretty much what got me through high school. So, rather than pick up the relatively safe (but still naughty) Canterbury Tales or Fanny Hill, here's my list of 5 riskier and more entertaining choices, in no particular order:

*   [Lolita][6] (1955) by Nabokov (long unpublished in English, seized by customs in the UK, banned in France).
*   [The Atrocity Exhibition][7] (1970) or [Crash][8] (1973) by Ballard. No, not the basis for the horrible movie with Ludacris, but it was [adapted by Cronenberg][9] and the 1996 film was also controversial. The first run of Ballard's experimental Atrocity Exhibition was destroyed by Doubleday.
*   [Naked Lunch][10] (1959) by Burroughs. The target of the last major [print] censorship trial in the US. I bet you'd still have a hard time finding it in a school library.
*   [A Clockwork Orange][11] (1962) by Burgess. If you've seen Kubrick's film, you can see why it's frequently challenged and removed from school libraries.

And while you're taking a well-deserved break from [Ulysses][12], why not listen to some [banned music][13]! We celebrate Banned Books Week, but the fight against censorship in music is still ongoing. Take a look back on...

*   [2 Live Crew - As Nasty As They Wanna Be][14]. 808 beats and a 1992 court overruling that remain at the heart of hip-hop.
*   [N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton][15]. The classic album, as well as 2 Live's Nasty, were both banned in Tennessee.
*   [Public Enemy - Hazy Shade of Criminal][16]. Banned from MTV because of violence and yet it's largely a protest against government-sanctioned violence, hmmmm....
*   [DJ Dangermouse - The Grey Album][18]. [Censorship continues under copyright law][17], so here's one of the highest achievements of "illegal" art ever.
